# Activity 3: Bookshelf API + UI

## Short description

A small digital bookshelf that lets you create and manage authors, categories, and books. The backend exposes CRUD API endpoints (NestJS) and the frontend (React + Vite) provides a minimal UI for viewing and managing books. API documentation is available via Swagger.

## Screenshots (placeholders)

- API / Swagger UI (replace with screenshot):

  [Insert Swagger UI screenshot here — open http://localhost:3000/api and capture the endpoints list]

- Frontend UI (replace with screenshot):

  [Insert frontend screenshot here — open the app (e.g. http://localhost:5174) and capture the books page or table]

## Instructions on how to run the project

From the repository root run the following (commands for bash.exe on Windows):

```bash
cd activity3
npm install
npm start
```

Note: the `npm start` command from the `activity3` folder is configured to run both backend and frontend for this activity.

## API Documentation (Swagger)

The backend hosts Swagger UI for the API. After starting the project, open:

http://localhost:3000/api

Use Swagger to explore and test the endpoints (create authors, categories, books, and list resources). Replace the screenshot placeholders above with captures from the running system.
